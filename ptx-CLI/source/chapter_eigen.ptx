  <title>Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      We have often explored new ideas in matrix algebra by making connections to our previous algebraic experience.
      Adding two numbers, <m>x+y</m>,
      led us to adding vectors <m>\vec{x}+\vec{y}</m> and adding matrices <m>A+ B</m>.
      We explored multiplication,
      which then led us to solving the matrix equation <m> A \vec{x} = \vec{b}</m> which was reminiscent of solving the algebra equation <m>ax=b</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      This chapter is motivated by another analogy.
      Consider: when we multiply an unknown number <m>x</m> by another number such as <m>5</m>, what do we know about the result?
      Unless, <m>x=0</m>, we know that in some sense <m>5x</m> will be
      <q><m>5</m> times bigger than <m>x</m>.</q>
      Applying this to vectors,
      we would readily agree that
      <m>5\vec{x}</m> gives a vector that is
      <q><m>5</m> times bigger than <m>\vec{x}</m>.</q>
      Each entry in <m>\vec{x}</m> is multiplied by <m>5</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Within the matrix algebra context, though,
      we have two types of multiplication:
      scalar and matrix multiplication.
      What happens to <m>\vec{x}</m> when we multiply it by a matrix <m>A</m>? Our first response is likely along the lines of
      <q>You just get another vector.
      There is no definable relationship.</q>
      We might wonder if there is ever the case where a matrix <mdash/> vector multiplication is very similar to a scalar <mdash/> vector multiplication.
      That is, do we ever have the case where <m>A\vec{x} = a\vec{x}</m>,
      where <m>a</m> is some scalar?
      That is the motivating question of this chapter.
