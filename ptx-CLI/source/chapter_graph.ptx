  <title>Graphical Explorations of Vectors</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      We already looked at the basics of graphing vectors.
      In this chapter, we'll explore these ideas more fully.
      One often gains a better understanding of a concept by
      <q>seeing</q>
      it.
      For instance, one can study the function
      <m>f(x)=x^2</m> and describe many properties of how the output relates to the input without producing a graph,
      but the graph can quickly bring meaning and insight to equations and formulae.
      Not only that,
      but the study of graphs of functions is in itself a wonderful mathematical world,
      worthy of exploration.

      We've studied the graphing of vectors;
      in this chapter we'll take this a step further and study some fantastic graphical properties of vectors and matrix arithmetic.
      We mentioned earlier that these concepts form the basis of computer graphics;
      in this chapter, we'll see even better how that is true.
